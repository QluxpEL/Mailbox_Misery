Mailbox Misery is a horror game where players take on the role of a mail delivery person. They must deliver mail around the city, collecting currency along the way, which can be used to purchase items for the upcoming night. During the night, a monster attempts to invade the house. Players can light up rooms to prevent the monster from entering specific areas, but doing so drains power. Additionally, the game features a music tape that, when activated, accelerates the in-game time, although it significantly increases the passage of time.

<h2 align="left">Biggest dificulty & What I learned</h2>
<p align="left">
One of the biggest challenges in developing this project was the fact that almost everything had to be created from scratch. This was one of the first games I built without using any free model scripts, which required me to design and implement every core system myself. The main menu logic, the join-code-recognition system, the NPC movement behavior, and all of the endings were fully written and customized for the project.

Working on this game significantly improved my knowledge of Roblox development. I gained practical experience with essential techniques such as DataStores, tweening, and teleportation, all of which were necessary to bring the project to completion.

In the end, this project became an important to my development journey and helped me build the confidence.
